# How would you print just the 10th line of a file?
#
# For example, assume that `file.txt` has the following content:
#
# ```
# Line 1
# Line 2
# Line 3
# Line 4
# Line 5
# Line 6
# Line 7
# Line 8
# Line 9
# Line 10
# ```
#
# Your script should output the tenth line, which is:
#
# ```
# Line 10
# ```

# Read from the file file.txt and output the tenth line to stdout.

# Solution 1
cnt=0
while read line && [ $cnt -le 10 ]; do
  let 'cnt = cnt + 1'
  if [ $cnt -eq 10 ]; then
    echo $line
    exit 0
  fi
done < file.txt

# Solution 2
awk 'FNR == 10 {print }'  file.txt
# OR
awk 'NR == 10' file.txt

# Solution 3
sed -n 10p file.txt

# Solution 4
tail -n+10 file.txt|head -1
